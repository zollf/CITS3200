\section{Objectives}
In this section, describe the purpose of this document.
Forecast the testing strategy, the unit tests, integation test and system tests listed in this document.

\section{Document References}
In this section, reference the major documents produced during project development.

Explains the relationships among the requirements documents, design documents, implementation documents and the test procedures.

\section{Test Summary}
In this section, describe the functions of the system tested in this document.

Refer to Requirements Analysis Document and Problem Statement.

\section{Testing Strategy}
In this section, define the subsystem or subsystems to be tested, the system integration strategy and how, where, when, and by whom the tests will be conducted.

You may want to include drawings depicting relationships among the major classes of the subsystem or the subsystem decomposition, if you feel this is appropriate.

\section{Front End Unit Tests}
All front end JavaScript unit tests, using the \texttt{jest} framework, should pass.

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open your CLI to the root of the repository.
    \item Run the command \texttt{yarn test}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expected Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All unit tests pass.
    \item At least 50\% test coverage.
\end{itemize}
The reason for the relatively low coverage is that most tests for the frontend will be integration tests.

\section{Back End Unit Tests}
All back end Python unit tests, using \texttt{pytest}, should pass.

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open your CLI to the root of the repository.
    \item Run the command \texttt{yarn test}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expected Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All unit tests pass.
    \item At least 75\% test coverage.
          \end{itemize}
    \item Procedures: The test procedure is often specificed in form of a test script.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Analysis Report}
The Test Analysis Report lists the functions and performance characteristics that were to be demonstrated, and describes the actual test results. The description of the results must include the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Function
    \item Performance
    \item Data measures, including whether target requirements have been met
\end{itemize}
If an error or deficiency has been discovered, the report discusses its impact.
