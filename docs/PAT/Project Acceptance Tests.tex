\section{Objectives}
In this section, describe the purpose of this document.
Forecast the testing strategy, the unit tests, integration test and system tests listed in this document.

\section{Test Summary}
In this section, describe the functions of the system tested in this document.

Refer to Requirements Analysis Document and Problem Statement.

\section{Testing Strategy}
In this section, define the subsystem or subsystems to be tested, the system integration strategy and how, where, when, and by whom the tests will be conducted.

You may want to include drawings depicting relationships among the major classes of the subsystem or the subsystem decomposition, if you feel this is appropriate.

\section{Front End Unit Tests}
All front end JavaScript unit tests, using the \texttt{jest} framework, should pass.

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open your CLI to the root of the repository.
    \item Run the command \texttt{yarn test}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expected Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All unit tests pass.
    \item At least 50\% test coverage.
\end{itemize}
The reason for the relatively low coverage is that most tests for the front end will be integration tests.

\section{Back End Unit Tests}
All back end Python unit tests, using \texttt{pytest}, should pass.

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open your CLI to the root of the repository.
    \item Run the command \texttt{yarn test}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expected Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All unit tests pass.
    \item At least 75\% test coverage.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Accessible Website}
The booking part of the website should be accessible to anyone with a modern web browser.

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigate to the main website URL in either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expected Result}
The initial page for booking will be shown.

\section{Applying for a Booking}
Once a user has access to the booking site, they can create a booking application.

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose a date.
    \item Choose a carpark.
    \item Choose a bay and time.
    \item Review the booking details before submitting.
    \item Submit application.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expected Result}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Booking details before submitting should be correct.
    \item The user should be sent an email confirming the application is submitted.
    \item The admin team should get an email notifying them of a new application that needs to be actioned.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Approving an Application}
An admin user should be able to approve an existing application.

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item As a normal user, create a booking application.
    \item As an admin, navigate to the approvals page.
    \item Click approve on the application.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expected Result}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User should be automatically emailed to notify them that their application was approved.
    \item The application in the admin panel should now show as approved.
\end{itemize}

\section{Declining an Application}
An admin user should be able to decline an existing application.

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item As a normal user, create a booking application.
    \item As an admin, navigate to the approvals page.
    \item Click decline on the application.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expected Result}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User should be automatically emailed to notify them that their application was declined.
    \item The application in the admin panel should now show as declined.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{PDF Generation} \label{pdf}
A PDF containing details about the booking should be automatically generated when a booking is approved.

\subsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Apply for a booking.
    \item An admin approves the booking.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expected Result}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A PDF should be available for download or viewing by the admin upon approval of the booking.
