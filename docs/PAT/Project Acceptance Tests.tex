\section{Unit Tests}
\subsection{Front End Unit Tests}
All front end JavaScript unit tests, using the \texttt{jest} framework, should pass.

\subsubsection{Test Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open your CLI to the root of the repository.

\subsubsection{Expected Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All unit tests pass.
    \item At least 50\% test coverage.
\end{itemize}
The reason for the relatively low coverage is that most tests for the front end will be integration tests.
